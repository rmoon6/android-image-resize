## What this will do

Given image files of size 3x (`xxhdpi`), this script will generate `xhdpi`, `mdpi`, and `hdpi` image files and place them in a directory structure that Android Studio can import

## How to run

- Create a folder called `input` in the repository home directory:
- In the `input` folder, place png files with size 3x
- Run `python image_resize.py`. Generated images will be in a folder called `output`.
